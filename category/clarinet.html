                <h1>The Development of the Clarinet</h1>

                <p>The first clarinet was created by German manufacturer Denner in Nuremberg around 1700. It is
                  therefore older than 300 years.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="article-content">
                <p>Similarities could be seen between the two-key clarinet of today and the two-key chalumeau of the
                  eighteenth century. Early 18th-century composers frequently mixed up the instruments. The lower
                  "chalumeau register" was intended for the chalumeau, and the high register was essentially
                  nonexistent. The lower "chalumeau register" was subpar on the clarinet and was intended for the
                  "clarinet register," the higher exaggerated notes.</p>

                <p>A register tube for the upper register and a key on the rear of the clarinet that was higher and
                  smaller than the chalumeau's were also features. The bore was larger than the chalumeau and resembled
                  a contemporary Bb instrument in size. The barrel of the clarinet bell was clearly flared and was
                  larger. The exaggerated register was intended for the clarinet mouthpiece.</p>

                <p>Over the years, I received a lot of emotional and occasionally irate emails indicating that the
                  clarinet has been around in the area for a very long time, which prompted me to do some more thorough
                  research. I still believe that the statement is true today, but it all depends on how you define
                  clarinets. I feel that I should clarify the facts and give a clearer explanation of the many
                  viewpoints. Thus, this article lengthens a little.</p>

                <h2>How old is clarinet music ?</h2>
                <p>The flute, then, was the oldest wind instrument discovered up until this point in time (2019), and
                  ancient images and descriptions from Sumer and Egypt (5000 years ago), later Greece, and the Etruscans
                  (3000–2000 years ago), show and describe ensembles with wind instruments, kitharas (harp-like
                  instruments), tamburin-like percussion instruments, rattles, and other instruments. The flutes that
                  were discovered and the flutes in photographs were tubes that were occasionally longer than modern
                  flutes, open on both ends, and blown over one end like the pipes of the syrinx panflute, but with six
                  tone holes instead of three. They were often played with one tube, but occasionally more than one at
                  once.</p>
                <img src="/Images/clarinet-2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="clarinet">

                <br>
                <p>Later came the reed instruments that you blow through, which might be double-reed (like an oboe) or
                  single-reed (like a clarinet) (3000 years ago). Candidates for "the first clarinet" were well
                  recognized at that time because the ancient Egyptians had many names for each type. In graveyards, the
                  bodies of the instruments were discovered. It is uncertain if they were double reeds or single reeds
                  as they were never equipped with reeds or mouthpieces. They are around the size of a modern recorder
                  (or could be used for both). Many of those wind instruments, like the Aulos, were sold in pairs and
                  had just four tone holes apiece; as a single instrument, they may have anywhere from six to nine.</p>

                <h2>More improvements on clarinet in the 1770's-80's</h2>

                <p>Most clarinets made between 1770 and 1880 were in C and Bb. Some clarinets featured a replaceable
                  upper joint (referred to as "pièces de rechange") that, when used, produced an A clarinet. It was
                  unusual to find a clarinet that was only an A. The bores were between 13 and 14 mm. When clarinets in
                  B or D were required, joints were added to the C and Eb clarinets. The reeds were stiff, short, and
                  thin. Many of the reeds from the late 1770s were made of pine or fir, while others were constructed of
                  cane.</p>

                <p>A key to trill between such a' and b' was only added shortly before 1790 and exclusively in England.
                  English clarinets of this era weren't typically as advanced as continental instruments. The chalumeau
                  register of the continental string instruments has larger tone holes and steadily improved sound. This
                  was significant to Mozart because he began composing solo clarinet pieces in the chalumeau register.
                </p>

                <h2>What distinguishes the clarinet from a better Chalumeau?</h2>

                <p>Denner had to lengthen the chalumeau in order to add four more tone holes, thus that was his first
                  task. However, since we only have 10 fingers, you can't use your fingers to close the 11 tone holes
                  and the speaker hole, therefore you'll need at least two keys. Finally, there is the clarinet, which
                  Denner added.</p>
                <p>It was a breakthrough, but Denner and subsequently his sons had to explore for a very long period
                  before they could create an instrument that could play both the lower and upper registers properly
                  without compromising too much intonation (that is correctness of the tone frequency). He made two
                  extra holes near the duodecime key in order to do this. The player used his embouchure to fix the
                  remaining intonation issues.</p>
                <p>The original clarinets were still quite basic and resembled a bigger recorder. Two keys were
                  available at first, then three (our description depicted here shows two: left thumb and left
                  forefinger). Compared to trumpets or oboes at the time, the new instrument already had a greater tonal
                  range. Additionally, however it would be impossible to perform technically challenging runs and jumps
                  on a trumpet, one could perform it relatively loudly. Therefore, the new instrument was initially used
                  in place of the high trumpets, or "clarini." That may be where the name "clarinet" originated.</p>

                <p class="card-description">
                  The guitar is an ancient and noble instrument, whose history can be traced back over 4000 years.
                  Many
                  theories have been advanced about the instrument's ancestry. It has often been claimed that the
                  guitar
                  is a development of the lute, or even of the ancient Greek kithara. Research done by Dr. Michael
                  Kasha
                  in the 1960's showed these claims to be without merit. He showed that the lute is a result of a
                  separate line of development, sharing common ancestors with the guitar, but having had no
                  influence on
                  its evolution. The influence in the opposite direction is undeniable, however - the guitar's
                  immediate
                  forefathers were a major influence on the development of the fretted lute from the fretless oud
                  which
                  the Moors brought with them to to Spain.

                  A flutes is a musical instrument with a tubular design that
                  is widely used around the world. Numerous holes may be found along the sides of flutes, and by
                  placing
                  fingers over the holes and pressing buttons that close the corresponding ones, different sounds
                  can be
                  generated. When played, some flutes, like the recorder and tin whistle, are held vertically. These
                  are
                  also known as fipple flutes because they contain a tiny component inside called a fipple that
                  guides
                  the air when the player blows into it. Other flutes, like the Western concert flute and the
                  Chinese
                  dizi, are held more longitudinally while they are played. Transverse or cross flutes are the names
                  given to these flutes.

                <p style="color: black;" class="card-description">
                  Sax was one of Charles and Marie Sax's eleven children. His father, who was first trained as a
                  carpenter but subsequently developed a passion for creating wind instruments, eventually obtained a
                  position as a judge in the Netherlands.

                <p class="card-description">
                  The invention of the first drum set in the late 19th century paved the way for the creation of the
                  contemporary drum kit we know of today.

                  Jazz drummers were among the first to put together drum sets, which makes sense given how crucial
                  drums are to jazz music.

                  Jazz drummers in New Orleans invented the current drum kit in the 1920s.

                  They combined many drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments to create a drum set out of
                  classical instruments.

                  Drummers were already customizing their kits by both the 1930s.
