                <h2>1. AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h2>
                <p>These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on
                  behalf of an entity (“you”) and Muxhistory ("Company," “we," “us," or “our”), concerning your access
                  to and use of the<a href="https://muxhistory.netlify.app/">https://muxhistory.netlify.app/</a>website
                  as well as
                  any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or
                  otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site”). You agree that by accessing the Site, you have
                  read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF
                  THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SITE AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE
                  IMMEDIATELY.</p>

                <p>The Site may occasionally post additional terms and conditions or documents, which are hereby
                  expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right to periodically update or modify
                  these Terms of Use in our sole discretion. Regarding any, we'll let you know

                  These Terms of Use may be changed at any time by amending the "Last modified" date, and you therefore
                  relinquish any right to receive

                  notification of each such change in detail. Please make sure you review the relevant Terms each time
                  you

                  use our website so that you are aware of the applicable Terms. You will be subject to, and will be
                  deemed to
                  have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your
                  continued use of the Site after the date such revised Terms of Use are posted.</p>

                <p>The information on the Site is not intended to be shared with or used by any individual or
                  organization in any area or country where doing so would be against the law or regulation or subject
                  us to any registration requirements in that jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
                  choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their
                  own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local
                  laws are applicable.</p>

                <p>If your interactions would be governed by legislation such as the Federal Information Security
                  Management Act (FISMA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or another
                  industry-specific rule, you are not permitted to use this site. You are not allowed to use the website
                  in a manner that contravenes the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).</p>

                <p>If a user is a minor in the jurisdiction in which they reside, they must have their parent's or
                  guardian's permission to use the site and be under their direct supervision (usually under the age of
                  18).
                  If you are a minor, you must have your parent or legal guardian read and approve these Terms of Use
                  before using the Site.</p>
