                <h1>Who invented the piano?</h1>
                
                <p>One of those inventions that is difficult to consider an invention is the piano because it has simply
                  always been there. It's difficult to resist asking yourself, "Why haven't I heard of this person
                  before?" when you consider that someone may have actually invented it. And why doesn't his name appear
                  on every piano in the world?</p>

              <div class="article-content">


                <p style="font-size: larger; color: black;">Although Cristofori may have been working on the piano for a
                  few years before to 1700, that year marks the first recorded mention of it. The earliest known piano
                  by Cristofori is from 1720. The advancement the piano symbolized was more significant than the date.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The harpsichord undoubtedly influenced the piano; in early documents, Cristofori referred to the piano
                  as an Arpicembalo, which translates to "harp-harpsichord," and he frequently developed and created
                  additional instruments that were harpsichord-like. By using a hammer instead of a string, the piano
                  advanced that instrument significantly. Its hammers and dampers, which could more deftly modulate
                  sound than the harpsichord's plucking motion, allowed for a better modulation of volume.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The earliest piano that has survived was created in 1721, and given that it sounds something like a
                  harpsichord, it is clear that it was a transitional instrument. The Metropolitan Museum of Art claims
                  that its sound is rather harpsichord-like because to its smaller range, thinner strings, and heavier
                  hammers than those of modern pianos.
                </p>

                <img src="/Images/piano-2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="piano">

                <p>
                  Cristofori worked for the Medici family and contributed to the regal system. He was truly hired to
                  work for the Medicis but initially placed in a workshop with about 100 other artisans (he complained
                  about how loud it was). Ferdinando de' Medici gave Cristofori permission to invent, but he was also
                  assigned responsibility for tuning, moving, and repairing certain older instruments. Cristofori was a
                  provincial good, as opposed to artists who played at royal courts and had the potential to become
                  famous around the world. He wasn't thought of as a revolutionary genius, but as a competent tinker.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Due to the fact that Cristofori was merely a hired man, we may not know much about him (albeit a
                  well-respected one). Cristofori was employed by <a
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinando_de%27_Medici,_Grand_Prince_of_Tuscany"> Ferdinando de'
                    Medici</a>, an Italian prince and part of
                  theÂ illustrious Italian family, to serve the court rather than only music.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Cristofori's invention of the piano may seem obvious, but the reason he is unknown outside of the
                  musical world is less clear. It might be a result of his work, the piano's escalating fame, and the
                  ensuing improvements. There is only one portrait of him because he wasn't particularly well-known when
                  he was alive and he's still not particularly well-known today. But in a way, that finesse is
                  appropriate for a trailblazer who introduced new tonal nuances to music. It is not Cristofori's piano
                  that is still playing; rather, it is the loud plucking of the harpsichord.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most inexperienced musicians will begin to respond when asked what kind of instrument a piano is, only
                  to discover that they truly don't know the answer! You do realize that it's not a string instrument
                  like a guitar or violin? It couldn't possible be a percussion instrument, can it, even though it
                  partly resembles instruments like xylophones? The piano is a percussion and string instrument, which
                  is a shocking truth! Learn how these string and percussion components came together to produce the
                  distinctive sound of the first modern piano as you proceed through the history of the piano below.

                <p class="card-description">
                  A flutes is a musical instrument with a tubular design that
                  is widely used around the world. Numerous holes may be found along the sides of flutes, and by
                  placing
                  fingers over the holes and pressing buttons that close the corresponding ones, different sounds
                  can be
                  generated. When played, some flutes, like the recorder and tin whistle, are held vertically. These
                  are
                  also known as fipple flutes because they contain a tiny component inside called a fipple that
                  guides
                  the air when the player blows into it. Other flutes, like the Western concert flute and the
                  Chinese
                  dizi, are held more longitudinally while they are played. Transverse or cross flutes are the names
                  given to these flutes.

                <p class="card-description">
                  The trumpet was still made of animal horns and conch shells
                  up until the 14th century. The animal horns were replaced with silver or brass trumpets at that point,
                  and the trumpet lost its archaic characteristics . As the trumpet gained popularity, people realized
                  that in addition to being able to amplify sound, it could also be used to modulate air output to
                  produce various pitches. Only males were permitted to learn to play the trumpet in medieval times, and
                  many armies exploited the trumpet's variation in pitch to send signals .</p>

                  Although there have been early specimens of this music
                  discovered all over the world, from South East Asia to Africa, it is generally agreed that the
                  instrument was created in Asia more than 4000 years ago. However, as papers from this era in the
                  region are not very reliable or thorough, it is challenging to determine precisely which South East
                  Asian country it originated in.

                <p class="card-description">
                  The invention of the first drum set in the late 19th century paved the way for the creation of the
                  contemporary drum kit we know of today.

                  Jazz drummers were among the first to put together drum sets, which makes sense given how crucial
                  drums are to jazz music.

                  Jazz drummers in New Orleans invented the current drum kit in the 1920s.

                  They combined many drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments to create a drum set out of
                  classical instruments.

                  Drummers were already customizing their kits by both the 1930s.
