                <h1>Who Invented Drumming?</h1>

                <p>Drums and percussion technique were developed by various performers and technological advancements,
                  therefore the question of who developed drumming cannot be answered conclusively.</p>

              <div class="article-content">


                <p style="font-size: larger; color: black;">Since they have been present for centuries, drums have
                  played a significant part in many different cultures.

                  There is no one person who can claim to have invented drumming because different musicians and
                  technological advancements contributed to the development of the drums and drumming style.

                  But in the 1920s, American jazz drummers began fusing various drums and percussion instruments to
                  create the current drum kits.

                  Let's learn more about the origins of the drum and the legendary figures who shaped drumming into what
                  it is today.</p>

                <h2>current set drums</h2>
                <p>Throughout history, drums were primarily used as separate instruments in military and orchestral
                  music settings.

                  In the 1860s, percussionists started combining several drums into a set.</p>


                <img src="/Images/set-drum-2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="drums">

                <br>
                <p>The invention of the first drum set in the late 19th century paved the way for the creation of the
                  contemporary drum kit we know of today.

                  Jazz drummers were among the first to put together drum sets, which makes sense given how crucial
                  drums are to jazz music.

                  Jazz drummers in New Orleans invented the current drum kit in the 1920s.

                  They combined many drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments to create a drum set out of
                  classical instruments.

                  Drummers were already customizing their kits by both the 1930s.

                  The five-piece drums became the standard, despite the fact that drum kits still varied in terms of
                  size and percussion/drum set count.</p>

                <h4>The components of a typical drum kit's basic arrangement were as follows:</h4>

                <ul>
                  <li>Large hanging cymbals</li>
                  <li>Tom toms</li>
                  <li>Bass drum and foot pedal</li>
                  <li>Snare drum</li>
                  <li>Hi-hat cymbal</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The evolution of drum kits as we know them now was influenced by the growth of rock music in the
                  1960s.

                  Electronic drums were first produced in the early 1970s because of advances in technology and many
                  drummers have subsequently substituted them for an acoustic kit.

                  It is only appropriate to give them the time in the spotlight they merit because so many musicians had
                  a significant impact on the evolution of the drums.</p>

                <h2>creators of the drumming</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Gene Krupa</li>
                  <li>Dee Dee Chandler</li>
                  <li>Remo Belli</li>
                  <li>Baby Dodds</li>
                  <li>William Lusdwig</li>
                  <li>Louis Bellson</li>
                  <li>Graeme Edge</li><span><a href="https://drummagazine.com/who-invented-drumming/">More</a></span>
                </ul>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                  Instead of being created by a single individual, percussion and drum kits were developed throughout
                  time by a number of musicians.

                  In the 20th century, American jazz drummers like Baby Dodds, Dee Dee Chandler, Gene Krupa, and many
                  more gave birth to the contemporary drum kit.

                <p class="card-description">
                  The trumpet was still made of animal horns and conch shells
                  up until the 14th century. The animal horns were replaced with silver or brass trumpets at that point,
                  and the trumpet lost its archaic characteristics . As the trumpet gained popularity, people realized
                  that in addition to being able to amplify sound, it could also be used to modulate air output to
                  produce various pitches. Only males were permitted to learn to play the trumpet in medieval times, and
                  many armies exploited the trumpet's variation in pitch to send signals .</p>

                  Similarities could be seen between the two-key clarinet of today and the two-key chalumeau of the
                  eighteenth century. Early 18th-century composers frequently mixed up the instruments. The lower
                  "chalumeau register" was intended for the chalumeau, and the high register was essentially
                  nonexistent. The lower "chalumeau register" was subpar on the clarinet and was intended for the
                  "clarinet register," the higher exaggerated notes.

                  Although there have been early specimens of this music
                  discovered all over the world, from South East Asia to Africa, it is generally agreed that the
                  instrument was created in Asia more than 4000 years ago. However, as papers from this era in the
                  region are not very reliable or thorough, it is challenging to determine precisely which South East
                  Asian country it originated in.
