                <h1>Origins of the guitar</h1>

                <p>
                  The guitar is an ancient and noble instrument, whose history can be traced back over 4000 years. Many
                  theories have been advanced about the instrument's ancestry. It has often been claimed that the guitar
                  is a development of the lute, or even of the ancient Greek kithara. Research done by Dr. Michael Kasha
                  in the 1960's showed these claims to be without merit. He showed that the lute is a result of a
                  separate line of development, sharing common ancestors with the guitar, but having had no influence on
                  its evolution. The influence in the opposite direction is undeniable, however - the guitar's immediate
                  forefathers were a major influence on the development of the fretted lute from the fretless oud which
                  the Moors brought with them to to Spain.
                </p>

                <p>The creation of the guitar as we know it did not occur at any one time. Due to a lack of
                  documentation and investigation, even its origins are challenging to determine. According to
                  historians, the first musical instruments that remarkably resembled the contemporary guitar may have
                  been created in Spain in the 12th century. While some have claimed that the current guitar is a
                  descendant of the medieval lute or possibly the Greek kithara, other historians have contested this
                  claim and indicated that the instrument originated from a different source. The Spanish moniker
                  "Guitarra Latina," which was used to refer to chordophones, the instruments most frequently associated
                  with the guitar, is perhaps where the word "guitar" originates.</p>

                <h2>Guitars in the Twentieth Century</h2>

                <p>
                  At the start of the 1900s, the guitar's popularity underwent a significant shift. The guitar had a
                  reputation for being a simple instrument to learn, and as it became more popular around the world,
                  more people gave it a try. The old strings were replaced with synthetic steel or nylon ones that were
                  easier on the fingers and, in some circumstances, had a more recognizable tone. The acoustic guitar,
                  which was louder than its forerunner but still derived from the classical guitar invented by Jurado
                  only a few centuries before, was produced.
                </p>



                <p>
                  Many people had tried to electrify the guitar, but it wouldn’t be until the 1930s that guitar pioneers
                  <a href="https://www.fender.com/articles/artists/8-things-you-might-not-know-about-leo-fender">Leo
                    Fender </a>and Les Paul began developing the acoustic guitar for electric purposes. The very first
                  electric guitars started to appear at the end of the 1930s with just one major design flaw – they were
                  hollow. This caused vibration and feedback when they were plugged into amplifiers. So, Leo Fender
                  created a durable, hard-body guitar that is still made and distributed to this day.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Recently, guitars have evolved to be lighter, more streamlined, customizable, and even more robust. As
                  evidence, consider Slash's Gibson Les Paul, Eric Clapton's vintage Fender Stratocaster, Bruce
                  Springsteen's Fender Esquire, or AC/Angus DC's Young's vintage Gibson SG. Some designs have even come
                  to represent iconic elements of music and rock culture.
                </p>
                <h2>The development</h2>

                <p>
                  Spaniard Antonio Torres Jurado is credited with creating the modern guitar. Around the year 1780,
                  Jurado examined the two existing guitar prototypes and believed that, if he could combine the greatest
                  features of each, it would take the instrument to a completely new level. He extended the neck and
                  enlarged the instrument's body. He employed wooden braces to bind it together because the strings
                  frequently caused the instrument to collapse on itself due to stress and pressure, guaranteeing it
                  could withstand being played. A louder, more well-rounded tone that has come to be associated with the
                  guitar was cast out by the guitar as a result of these improvements, which also resulted in an
                  improvement in the guitar's loudness and projection.
                </p>

                <p>
                  However, musicians who play the guitar and make songs continue to detest it. It was generally thought
                  of as a lesser instrument when compared to the orchestral instruments used by the top musicians of the
                  day and classical composers like <a href="https://www.classicfm.com/composers/mozart/">Mozart</a>,
                  Beethoven, and Bach. The Jurado guitar's design, which is now
                  known as the classical guitar, made the instrument more streamlined and player-friendly, but it did
                  little to boost the guitar's appeal.
                </p>

                <h2>The guitar Overview</h2>

                <p>
                  The word "guitar" derives from the old Sanskrit word "tar" for string. The languages of northern India
                  and central Asia (which are descended from this language) were evolved from it. Archeological
                  artifacts in the region demonstrate that several stringed folk instruments from Central Asia still
                  exist today and have been played there for many thousand years virtually exactly the same way. Many
                  have names that end in "tar," with the number of strings indicated by the prefix:
                </p>
                <h5>Four, five, and six string guitars</h5>
                <p>
                  As we've seen, Egypt and Mesopotamia are where the guitar's progenitors first arrived in Europe. Since
                  the word "guitar" is derived from the Old Persian word "chartar," which directly translates to "four
                  strings," these early instruments often featured four strings, as we have seen above. From Roman times
                  up until the Middle Ages, many of these instruments, and variations with three to five strings, may be
                  seen in medieval illustrated manuscripts and carved in stone in churches and cathedrals. Roman
                  "guitar," circa 200 CE.
                </p>
                <h5>Antonio Stradivarius's five-course guitar, 1680</h5>
                <p>
                  In the seventeenth century, the Italian "guitarra battente" gained a sixth course of strings, and
                  guitar builders throughout Europe adopted the practice. Six single strings eventually replaced the
                  six-course configuration, and once more it appears that the Italians were the driving force. (Thus, as
                  opposed to what is typically believed, the six-string guitar can be said to be a derivation of the
                  twelve-string guitar.)

                  At least some pre-existing five-course instruments appear to have been altered to the new stringing
                  pattern during the switch from five courses to six single strings. Since all that needed to be done
                  was swap out the nut and bridge and seal four of the tuning peg holes, this project was rather
                  straightforward. a stunningly detailed guitar made by the

                <h5>Electric and steel-string guitars</h5>
                <p>
                  Orville Gibson began creating archtop guitars with oval sound holes at the end of the 19th century. He
                  combined a body more closely resembling that of a cello with a steel-string guitar, with the bridge
                  applying pressure solely downward and no torque to the top. Because of this, the top may vibrate more
                  freely and generate more volume. Designer Lloyd Loar joined Gibson at the beginning of the 1920s and
                  improved the archtop "jazz" guitar into the shape that is today recognized, adding f-holes, a floating
                  bridge, and a tailpiece resembling a cello.

                <p class="card-description">
                  The harp is one of the initial stringed instruments. The harp has long been a sacred instrument that
                  priests and priestesses have used to communicate with the gods.

                  According to tomb art, harps were used in Mesopotamia as early as the fifth century BC.

                  Following that, it had five to seven strings. Compared to the abundance of harps discovered in Egypt,
                  Mesopotamia has relatively few harps.

                  The harp was pictured on paintings adorning Theban tombs, stelae, sculptures of players, and everyday
                  objects.

                <p class="card-description">
                  One of those inventions that is difficult to consider an invention is the piano because it has simply
                  always been there. It's difficult to resist asking yourself, "Why haven't I heard of this person
                  before?" when you consider that someone may have actually invented it. And why doesn't his name appear
                  on every piano in the world?

                  Sax was one of Charles and Marie Sax's eleven children. His father, who was first trained as a
                  carpenter but subsequently developed a passion for creating wind instruments, eventually obtained a
                  position as a judge in the Netherlands.

                <p class="card-description">
                  The invention of the first drum set in the late 19th century paved the way for the creation of the
                  contemporary drum kit we know of today.

                  Jazz drummers were among the first to put together drum sets, which makes sense given how crucial
                  drums are to jazz music.

                  Jazz drummers in New Orleans invented the current drum kit in the 1920s.

                  They combined many drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments to create a drum set out of
                  classical instruments.

                  Drummers were already customizing their kits by both the 1930s.
