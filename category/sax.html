                <h1>A Summary of Adolphe Sax's Past</h1>

                <p>In 1814, Belgium saw the birth of Adolphe Sax, the saxophone's creator. Although everyone seems to
                  have called him Adolphe when he was a young child, his real name was Antoine-Joseph.</p>

                <p>
                  Sax was one of Charles and Marie Sax's eleven children. His father, who was first trained as a
                  carpenter but subsequently developed a passion for creating wind instruments, eventually obtained a
                  position as a judge in the Netherlands.

                  Adolphe had so many near-fatal mishaps as a child that the locals started calling him "Young Sax, the
                  Ghost." Four consecutive near poisonings, a gunpowder explosion that resulted in burns, tumbling down
                  three flights of stairs and banging his head on a stone floor, among other mishaps, were among them.
                </p>

                <img src="/Images/sax-1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="saxophone">

              </div>
              <div class="article-content">
                <p>Adolphe studied at Brussels' Royal School of Music. He was a skilled clarinetist who also studied
                  voice and the flute.

                  Eight of Adolphe's siblings passed away between 1839 and 1840. Adolphe is thought to have thrown
                  himself into his job in order to deal with his loss and started assembling a collection of instruments
                  to be shown at the 1841 Brussels Exhibition. He quickly departed for Paris from Brussels following
                  that.</p>

                <p>
                  It is unknown if Adolphe ever got married. He is thought to have been romantically involved with
                  Louise-Adele Maor. Together, they had five children.

                  In 1894, Sax passed away and was laid to rest in Paris's Montmartre cemetery.
                </p>
                <h2>The Invention of the Saxophone</h2>
                <p>
                  Adolphe Sax started creating the blueprints for an instrument in the early 1840s that blended the
                  greatest features of brass and woodwind instruments. This required Sax to combine the suppleness of
                  woodwinds with the projection of brass instruments.

                  Sax wanted to make a string-blending instrument for use in orchestras. Additionally, he desired for
                  this instrument to have a stronger, richer tone and volume than stringed instruments.
                </p>
                <img src="/Images/sax-2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="saxophone">

                <p>
                  Many historians believe that Sax's dissatisfaction with the ophicleide he was working on is what led
                  to the invention of the saxophone. Bands from the 19th century used ophicleides, a keyed brass
                  instrument played with a brass mouthpiece. Sax switched to a bass clarinet mouthpiece in place of the
                  brass mouthpiece because they like the deeper, richer tone.

                  Sax started producing saxophones out of brass because it was challenging to make a tapered tube out of
                  wood, which was required for the instrument's body. Each saxophone in the family uses a single cane
                  reed and has a conical bore.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1846, Sax obtained a fifteen-year patent for the saxophone family. This allowed anyone to reproduce
                  Sax's instruments until it lapsed in the early 1860s.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eight saxophones were part of the <a href="https://www.notestem.com/blog/saxophone-family/">
                    saxophone</a> family mentioned in the patent. They are the following:
                  Bourdon Saxophone in C or Bb, Contrabass Saxophone in G or Ab, Tenor Sax in Eb, Saxophone in C,
                  Saxophone in Bb, and four additional woodwind instruments pitched one octave higher than for the
                  aforementioned instruments. The sopranino to subcontrabass range of the saxophones was meant to be
                  covered.

                  According to Sax's description in the patent, the saxophone fingerings "have some of the features of
                  the flute and of the clarinet."

                  Sax wanted his saxophone family to be employed in symphonies and military bands.
                </p>
                <h2>Facts Worth Knowing About Adolphe Sax</h2>
                <p>
                  Along with the instruments he created, Adolphe Sax also created the first air purifier. A metal box
                  with six straight, parallel plates in the lid served as the purifier. The plates were sealed before
                  being submerged in a ready-made tar and creosote solution. A room was filled with the solution's
                  vapors once the package was opened. Tar and turpentine were once believed to have antiseptic qualities
                  and be beneficial for treating respiratory conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Legion of Honor, the highest French honor given to a French national or foreigner for achievements
                  in the military or civic spheres related to service to France, the titles of Imperial Instrument Maker
                  and Private Director of Music to the Emperor were given to Adolphe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sax experienced many setbacks in both his personal and professional lives. Despite all of his
                  discoveries and accolades, he had to repeatedly file for bankruptcy, battle lip cancer, and ultimately
                  perished in abject poverty.

                <p class="card-description">
                  The guitar is an ancient and noble instrument, whose history can be traced back over 4000 years.
                  Many
                  theories have been advanced about the instrument's ancestry. It has often been claimed that the
                  guitar
                  is a development of the lute, or even of the ancient Greek kithara. Research done by Dr. Michael
                  Kasha
                  in the 1960's showed these claims to be without merit. He showed that the lute is a result of a
                  separate line of development, sharing common ancestors with the guitar, but having had no
                  influence on
                  its evolution. The influence in the opposite direction is undeniable, however - the guitar's
                  immediate
                  forefathers were a major influence on the development of the fretted lute from the fretless oud
                  which
                  the Moors brought with them to to Spain.

                <p class="card-description">
                  The trumpet was still made of animal horns and conch shells
                  up until the 14th century. The animal horns were replaced with silver or brass trumpets at that point,
                  and the trumpet lost its archaic characteristics . As the trumpet gained popularity, people realized
                  that in addition to being able to amplify sound, it could also be used to modulate air output to
                  produce various pitches. Only males were permitted to learn to play the trumpet in medieval times, and
                  many armies exploited the trumpet's variation in pitch to send signals .</p>

                  One of those inventions that is difficult to consider an invention is the piano because it has simply

                  Although there have been early specimens of this music
                  discovered all over the world, from South East Asia to Africa, it is generally agreed that the
                  instrument was created in Asia more than 4000 years ago. However, as papers from this era in the
                  region are not very reliable or thorough, it is challenging to determine precisely which South East
                  Asian country it originated in.

                <p class="card-description">
                  The invention of the first drum set in the late 19th century paved the way for the creation of the
                  contemporary drum kit we know of today.

                  Jazz drummers were among the first to put together drum sets, which makes sense given how crucial
                  drums are to jazz music.

                  Jazz drummers in New Orleans invented the current drum kit in the 1920s.

                  They combined many drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments to create a drum set out of
                  classical instruments.

                  Drummers were already customizing their kits by both the 1930s.
